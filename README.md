# 🎓 EduPro: Student Segmentation and Personalized Course Recommendation System

## 📖 Overview

EduPro is a machine learning-based web application that segments learners based on their learning behavior and provides personalized course recommendations.

The project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, and recommendation techniques to improve learner engagement and the online learning experience.
